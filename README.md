### Tuya Module 32001-000140
The original WiFi-Module is an ESP8266 and it's original Tuya firmware can be replaced with Tasmota or esphome. It's case is easy to open and solderpads for serial connection are available. The wired UART for the connection to the AC's mainboard uses tx_pin: GPIO15 / rx_pin: GPIO13
